[1mNAME[0m
       sddm - the simple desktop display manager

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       sddm [OPTIONS...]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       sddm is a display and login manager based on Qt technologies.

       Using QtQuick and QML, designers are given the ability to easily create pleasant, modern looking interfaces for sddm.

       sddm runs the greeter as a system user named [1msddm [22mwhose home directory needs to be set to [1m/var/lib/sddm[22m.

       If pam and systemd are available, the greeter will go through logind, which will give it access to drm devices.

       Distributions  without pam and systemd will need to put the [1msddm [22muser into the [1mvideo [22mgroup, otherwise errors regarding GL and drm devices might be ex‚Äê
       perienced.

       For X11 sessions, the cookie for X authorization is written into a temporary file [4m/tmp/xauth_XXXXXX[24m, owned and only accessible by the user.
